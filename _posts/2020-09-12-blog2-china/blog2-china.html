“Come on, Wuhan!” Source from Xiaotao Chen.

<p>“My city was sick, but I still love him.”<br />
I still remember when I read this sentence in January, tears welled up in my eyes. At that time, Wuhan experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, and then COVID-19 spread started throughout other provinces in China. The Spring Festival of 2020 was not be celebrated in a festive atmosphere, but with the fear of COVID-19.<br />
Today, we have come out of the shadow of COVID-19, and our faces are smiling again. And I want to talk about some stories in Hubei province, what happened there?</p>

<h2 id="covid-19-in-hubei-province">Covid-19 in Hubei Province</h2>
<p>At the mid-February this year, I heard a sad story from a friend. All four members of his friend’s family were diagnosed with COVID-19, including an 8-month-old baby.</p>
<p>The family comes from Tianmen city, Hubei province, but they were working in Wuhan. They bought train tickets before and planned to return to Tianmen on January 24 to celebrate the Spring Festival with their parents. At that time, people did not know what was happening, and the whole country was in a festive mood, waiting for the most important festival of the year.</p>
<p>Since late January, everything has changed. Most of the cities in Hubei province began to lockdown from January 23, as shown in Table <a href="#tab:tab1">1</a>. All the traffic was regulated, and people had to stay at home. TV stations are no longer the previews of The New Year’s party, but the rolling notifications of the epidemic. People’s talk is no longer about holidays but of exponentially increasing cases. Everyone is in a state of panic.</p>

<p>Wuhan, as the largest transportation hub in the central city, transported a large number of passengers to other cities before people knew about COVID-19 during the Spring Festival travel rush. No one can know if a passenger travelling with you was infected by the COVID-19. And if you follow the COVID infection curve in Hubei, as shown in the Figure <a href="#fig:dynamic-plot">1</a>, you will find that the number of confirmed cases showed an exponential increase pattern, which peaked in late February. The widespread transmission of COVID-19 in Hubei province may be positively related to the mass population mobility due to the Spring Festival travel rush in 2020<span class="citation" data-cites="jiang2020influence">(Jiang and Luo <a href="#ref-jiang2020influence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>From Table <a href="#tab:tab1">1</a>, we can know that Wuhan had the largest number of confirmed cases with 50340 in Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the epidemic. But what about other cities in Hubei province? You can get some insights from Figure <a href="#fig:map-plot">2</a>, the number of confirmed cases in cities bordering Wuhan was higher than in other cities, except for Xiantao and Xianning. Moreover, I found some interesting findings that the number of confirmed cases in Qianjiang, Enshi and Shennongjia is relatively low, especially Shennongjia has the lowest number of confirmed cases with 11 [<a href="#tab:tab1">1</a>] in the whole province.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons being that they were the two cities with the lowest imported population in Wuhan during the Spring Festival travel rush<span class="citation" data-cites="jiang2020influence">(Jiang and Luo <a href="#ref-jiang2020influence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Also, Shennongjia is sparsely populated, with an urban population of only 0.078912. And Qianjiang municipal government began to implement strict travel restrictions on January 17<span class="citation" data-cites="chi">(C. Zhang <a href="#ref-chi" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, six days earlier than the provincial government’s lockdown policy, which effectively slowed the spread of the COVID-19<span class="citation" data-cites="chang">(Chang et al. <a href="#ref-chang" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the end, Qianjiang became the first Hubei cities to remove strict travel restrictions. And the Wuhan lockdown officially ended on April 8, 2020.</p>

<p>As of end of 08:47 GMT on September 16, the global death toll from COVID-19 had reached 939,185, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:covid">3</a>. And the death toll in Hubei province was 68135. It was heartbreaking to see the statistics, especially when I have to relive people’s stories and cold statistics over and over again. It was the first time in my living memory that I had experienced the devastation of an event on a global scale.</p>
<p>To think and learn from pain, what reflection can death toll bring to us? If we could do it all over again, would we do it better? Next, let’s talk about the relationship between GDP, population and death cases, represented by the top 10 cities in deaths outside Wuhan in Hubei Province.</p>
<p>From Figure <a href="#fig:gdp-dead">4</a>, I found some unexpected facts that the death rate of Yichang, which ranks second in GDP, is as high as 0.04. However, Suizhou, whose GDP is much lower than that of average GDP for Hubei Province, has the same death rate of 0.034 as Xiangyang, whose GDP ranks first. Also, we can find that the mortality rate for Huanggang reached 0.043, which was related to the local poor medical conditions. In the same situation, the GDP level of Ezhou and Jingmen is stuck in the average line, and the mortality rate of these two cities are 0.042 and 0.044, respectively.</p>

Figure 4: The relationship between GDP, Population and Deaths, represented by the top 10 cities in mortality rate outside Wuhan in Hubei Province. Red line represents the average GDP for Hubei province. The larger the dot, the higher the death rate.

</div>
<p>It seems that there is no apparent correlation between GDP and mortality, so I further studied the correlation coefficient, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:correlation">5</a>. We can find that the correlation coefficient between GDP and mortality is -0.096, showing a negative correlation, but there is no evidence to establish a strong correlation between the two. That is an interesting finding. In general, we associate GDP with health care, and higher GDP means higher health care expenditure and better health condition. But from the above analysis, I can’t prove it. However, due to the lack of historical health expenditure data for each city, I was unable to conduct further analysis. Also, the untimely response at the initial stage of the outbreak may lead to an increase in mortality, which will lead to bias in the analysis.</p>

<p>To sum up, a better health system and better medical conditions would make a significant contribution to the reduction of mortality<span class="citation" data-cites="budhdeo2015changes">(Budhdeo et al. <a href="#ref-budhdeo2015changes" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.
